I did the projects and tasks in the portfolio on my own. They concerned web and mobile applications. I had to read the requirements and based on them, create a test plan, create test cases, bug reports, RTM and test report summary. I used tools such as: Jira, Excel, TestRail, Android Studio, Postman.
